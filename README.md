# GraphTraversal
***INTRODUCTION***
<br>
Graph traversal is a fundamental concept in graph theory, a significant area of study within computer 
science and mathematics that involves the analysis and manipulation of graphs. Graphs are abstract 
structures consisting of vertices (also called nodes) and edges (or links) that represent relationships or 
connections between pairs of objects. These structures are highly versatile and can model a wide range 
of real-world systems, such as social networks, transportation networks, communication systems, and 
biological networks. As such, efficient traversal of graphs is critical for solving numerous practical 
problems in these domains.

***ALGORITHM USED***
<br>
This program demonstrates two fundamental graph traversal algorithms: <br>
-Breadth-First Search (BFS)<br>
-Depth-First Search (DFS). <br>
<br>BFS explores the graph level by level using a queue, visiting all immediate neighbors before moving deeper. DFS, on the other hand, explores as far as possible along each branch using recursion (or a stack-based approach). Both algorithms work on an undirected graph represented using an adjacency matrix.
